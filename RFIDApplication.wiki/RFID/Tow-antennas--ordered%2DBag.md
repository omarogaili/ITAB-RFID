###<font color="f09144"> Description:</font>
the  sheilding of the RFID didn´t gave a different result. the issue is we need to have another or more effective shield around the antenna. 
we did have a bad founding in long distance. but still the result is not zero as we expected. and the founding av the product under the RFID-antenna is not 100% but it was 41% of 19 products. the products we did found under the shielded antenna was :

- FARFALLE 

- Lobero Wet wipes 

- KöttBuljong 

- Lipton tea 

- Sfoglia 

- Hjorthorns Salt 

- Zendium 

- ARVID NORDQUIST Coffee

so what i thing we need to do is to have more effective shield around the antenna.
